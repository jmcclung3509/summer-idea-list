# summer-idea-list
Created an app to store summer todo ideas. 


Created a simple list-style app using JavaScript.  Allows user to enter an item and save it to the page. When entered the item is displayed along with the user name and the date.  A check-button can be clicked to indicate the item as been completed, or the item can be deleted from the page by clicking on the delete button. A deleted item can also be restored to the page by clicking the undo delete button.
